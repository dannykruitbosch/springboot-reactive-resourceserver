# springboot-reactive-resourceserver


This is a simple example to setup a SpringBoot resource server using reactive components.
It uses MS AzureAD to validate tokens.

Please set `AZURE_TENANTID` in `application.yml` to your Azure tenantId before running the application
You also need to setup an application in Azure Active Directory (for OIDC) before using this example.
